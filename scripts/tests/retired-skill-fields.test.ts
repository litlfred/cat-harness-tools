/**
 * A field retired from `SkillDefinition` does not quietly come back.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Two fields were retired from `SkillDefinition` on 2026-09-20 — `schemaRefs`
 * (beans `3w0i`, `t2yg`) and `roles` (bean `y1w9`) — and both were retired
 * the same way: the property stayed **optional and deprecated** so a
 * downstream instance still validates, while every declaration in this
 * instance was removed. `roles` was then deleted outright in #1168 B8 (the
 * schema is not strict, so data still carrying it still validates); the
 * guard below holds either way.
 *
 * That shape has a hole in it. An optional property re-declared typechecks
 * cleanly, so nothing fails, nothing warns outside an editor, and the field
 * is back with no reader — which is the state it was retired from.
 *
 * The cost of not pinning a decision is already measured here. `dhol`: the
 * `*.test.ts` exclusion in `check-declared-paths` was written and never
 * argued, and survived three breakages because there was nothing to disagree
 * with. This is the cheapest possible way not to repeat that.
 *
 * **This is not a ban.** Reinstating either field is fine — the rule both
 * retirement records state is *write the consumer first*. Do that, and
 * update this test in the same change; the diff is then a decision somebody
 * reviewed rather than a line that reappeared.

 * on the {@link SchemaRef} type it belongs to. What matters is that each path
