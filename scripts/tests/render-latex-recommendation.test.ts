/**
 * A document folio's `recommendation` block in LaTeX (bean `55ao`).
 *
 * No document-profile preamble defines a `recommendation` environment, and
 * mapping it to `remark` would print the wrong word. So it renders as a
 * run-in `\paragraph` in the document's own words, anchored like a labelled
 * prose block. These tests pin that, and pin that it does not reach the
 * environment table, where an unknown kind throws.
