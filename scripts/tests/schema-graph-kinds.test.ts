/**
 * The schema-graph projection's validator knows every kind the generator
 * emits.
 *
 * `schema-graph.ts` types a declaration's kind as `DeclKind`;
 * `schemas/site-indexes.ts` validates the projection against `DECL_KINDS`.
 * They are two lists of one fact, and they drifted: `json-schema` (bootstrap's
 * `.schema.json` declarations) was emitted 28 times and accepted by nothing,
 * so `check:kind-validators` failed the committed `docs/assets/schemas/index.json`
 * (folio-assistant#2518, 2026-10-09). Not an import from `scripts/` into
 * `schemas/` — that would point the dependency the wrong way — but this test,
 * which fails to COMPILE when a kind is added to one list and not the other.
