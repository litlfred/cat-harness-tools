/**
 * cat-harness reaches bootstrap-tools by PACKAGE NAME, never by climbing out of
 * its own directory — bean `pxtk`, the first layer of epic `f6gq` (separation
 * lesson 5: "All cross-repository imports MUST be authored as package
 * imports ... NEVER through escaping filesystem `../..` traversals").
 *
 * The name resolves through bun WORKSPACES to the one copy the checkout mounts,
 * pinned by its `index.lock.json`, so there is no second version to drift from
 * the mount: `bootstrap-tool[s]` matches it inside cat-harness's own repository
 * (mounted at its root) and `../bootstrap-tool[s]` beside it (the monorepo, a
 * downstream checkout such as who-iris). A bracket glob matches nothing rather
 * than failing when the mount is absent — bun refuses a literal workspace path
 * that does not exist, and an install may run before a mount.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/tests/package-imports
