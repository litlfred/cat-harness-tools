/**
 * Write `$schema: bean/1.0.0` back into every bean that lacks it, or, with
 * `--check`, fail on one that still lacks it.
 *
 * Bean `ujiv`, issue litlfred/cat-harness#88.
 *
 * ## Why the tag is restored rather than trusted
 *
 * A bean is a node kind (`bean/1.0.0`, `schemas/bean-graph.ts#BeanNodeKind`)
 * and says so in its own front matter, as every node-kind file does. But the
 * `beans` CLI owns that front matter. `beans update` rewrites it and drops every
 * key it does not know, `$schema` included (measured 2026-10-06 on a scratch
 * store), and `beans create` never writes one. A tag written once would be gone
 * the next time anyone claimed the bean.
 *
 * So the tag is put back after the CLI has had its turn: at session start,
 * before each commit, and by `state:push` before it splices the store onto its
 * branch. `--check` is the gate that says when none of those ran.
 *
 * ## What it changes
 *
 * One line of front matter, inserted after the `# <id>` comment the CLI writes
 * first. Nothing else in the file moves, so a retag is a one-line diff per bean.
 *
 * A bean that already carries some OTHER `$schema` is reported and left alone.
 * Another tag is a newer major this script does not know, or a mistake, and in
 * either case overwriting it hides the finding.
 *
 * ## Which store
 *
 * The one this checkout resolves, read the way every bean gate reads it
 * (`bean-store-read.ts`): `beans/defs/` and its `archive/`. Where the graph is
 * kept on its branch, that is the MOUNT, so a retag writes into the mount and
 * `state:push` carries it to the branch. An unmounted store is "could not
 * check", never a clean run. `--dir <path>` names a `defs/` directory directly,
 * for a worktree of the branch or a store in another checkout.
 *
 * `--quiet` prints only when something changed or went wrong. `--print-paths`
 * prints the absolute path of each file it tagged, one per line and nothing
 * else, so the pre-commit hook can tell which of them git tracks.
 *
 * Exit codes follow the bean gates: 0 every bean tagged, 1 a defect (untagged
 * under `--check`, or a foreign tag), 2 could not check.
 *
