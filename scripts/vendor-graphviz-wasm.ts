/**
 * Vendor Graphviz, compiled to WebAssembly, into the docs site for the
 * interactive KG subgraph viewer (`docs/assets/js/kg-graph.js`).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-09: *"i think there is webasm graphviz?"* and *"could use the
 * wasm-graphviz to make the graph visualizers overview more dynamic. also
 * allow users to drag nodes around for better visualization."* The viewer lays
 * a DOT file out in the reader's browser, so it needs Graphviz there.
 *
 * It is loaded from `docs/assets/js/vendor/wasm-graphviz/` and NOT from a CDN,
 * for the reasons `vendor-sqlite-wasm.ts` measured and the `kg-viewer` skill
 * states: a third host in the trust boundary of a page that shows this
 * repository's own data, and a page that cannot be tested where the CDN is
 * refused. "No CDN" means no THIRD party's; a script this site publishes
 * itself is the opposite case.
 *
 * One file is copied, `dist/index.js` (about 740 KB): the ESM bundle with the
 * WASM inlined, so there is no second fetch to resolve. The SOURCE is the
 * devDependency `@hpcc-js/wasm-graphviz`, pinned exactly, so an upgrade is a
 * `package.json` bump plus `bun run cat kg-graph:vendor`, and `--check` fails
 * when the vendored bytes differ from the pinned package (a hand-edit, or a
 * bump that was never re-vendored).
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/vendor-graphviz-wasm
 * @covers none — vendored third-party bytes compared with their pinned package; no declared graph typology
