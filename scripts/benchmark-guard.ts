/**
 * Guard against benchmark runs writing into declared knowledge-graph directories.
 *
 * Bean: folio-assistant-wp49 ("TEST MODE: benchmarking output is a report, and deliberately not KG content")
 * Issue: #363
 *
 * Every other verdict in the platform lands inside a declared graph (`test/results/` for
 * `qa`, `test/attestations/` for `attestations`, `test/health/results/` for `health`).
 * Benchmark outputs are the deliberate exception: they are assertions about the model
 * and runner configuration at a single point in time, not facts about the subject folio.
 *
 * Admitting benchmark metrics into the knowledge graph would make graph contents depend
 * on which model happened to run. Therefore, benchmark outputs must land in `build/`
 * (e.g. `build/benchmarks/`) or `reports/`, and are forbidden from writing into any
 * declared graph directory.
