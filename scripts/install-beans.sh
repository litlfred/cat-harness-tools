# Install the `beans` issue-tracker CLI (https://github.com/hmans/beans).
#
# `beans` is the session work-plan + cross-agent coordination tracker used by
# this repo (data lives in `beans/`, see `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/todo-manager.md`).
# It is a Go binary distributed via GitHub releases; fresh cloud sandboxes do
# NOT ship it, so this script reinstalls it on demand.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install-beans.sh            # install if missing
#   scripts/install-beans.sh --force    # reinstall even if present
#   BEANS_VERSION=v0.x.y scripts/install-beans.sh   # pin a release tag
#
# Primary method: `go install` (Go >= 1.21 required; the sandbox ships Go).
# The GitHub releases API is often firewalled in sandboxes, so we prefer the
# module proxy (proxy.golang.org) that `go install` uses.
