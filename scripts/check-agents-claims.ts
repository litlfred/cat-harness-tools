/**
 * The claims `AGENTS.md` makes ABOUT CODE are checked against the code.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-agents-claims
 * @covers code — its subject is the CODE a prose claim asserts about — the symbols and paths it
 *   names. The `AGENTS.md` it reads is this instance's declared `agent-instructions` asset
 *
 * Bean `77ex`. Two checks already cover `AGENTS.md` and neither covers this:
 * `check:agents-xref` verifies citations INTO it, `check:agent-entry-links`
 * verifies links OUT of it. Neither reads what the prose ASSERTS.
 *
 * ## Two claim shapes, and the second is the one that cost something
 *
 * **LOCATION** — `` `symbol` in `module.ts` ``. Catches a symbol renamed or
 * removed while the prose kept its old name.
 *
 * **ABSENCE** — `` `symbol` `` … "has no caller", "nothing calls it", "is not
 * reachable". This is the expensive one, and `AGENTS.md` says why in its own
 * voice: *"a stale gap notice is worse than none, because an agent that
 * believes it either avoids the feature or rebuilds it."*
 *
 * ## The bean's own design would not have caught its own example
 *
 * `77ex` proposed the LOCATION check and asked, as its third done-when, to
 * falsify it against the two real claims from git history. Doing that first
 * is what found the problem. At `08f43c55b2` the file said:
 *
 * > `resolveSkillDirs` in `schemas/folio-config.ts` computes the
 * > cross-instance skill overlay and has **no caller**
 *
 * `schemas/folio-config.ts` existed at that commit and did declare
 * `resolveSkillDirs` — verified with `git show`. The LOCATION claim was
 * **true**. What was false was "no caller", which a location check never
 * looks at. So the ABSENCE check is not an extension here; it is the half
 * that catches the motivating case.
 *
 * The bean's second example — *"declares `schemas/` and `skills/` only"* — is
 * a claim about a config file's CONTENTS and is caught by neither. That is
 * stated in the report rather than quietly dropped.
 *
 * ## Why it does not grep English
 *
 * The bean is explicit that a checker over prose will cry wolf and be
 * switched off, and this repository has already paid for one such proxy. So
 * every claim must carry a BACKTICKED symbol and a recognised shape; anything
 * else is counted as **not parsed** and reported as its own state. A sentence
 * the checker did not understand is not a sentence it verified.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat check:agents-claims
 * Exit:   0 clean · 1 a claim is false · 2 nothing could be parsed
