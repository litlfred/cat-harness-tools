/**
 * After a move between two layers lands, rewrite the paths that still name the
 * old home — and ONLY those, and never in a record.
 *
 * @module scripts/rewrite-moved-paths
 * @graphNode none — a command-line tool; the method is skill `kg-separation` §"After a move lands"
 *
 * ## The rule, and why each half of it is needed
 *
 * A mention `<from-name>/<prefix>/<rest>` is rewritten to
 * `<to-name>/<prefix>/<rest>` when, and only when,
 *
 * 1. the file EXISTS under the destination root (`<to-root>/<prefix>/<rest>`), and
 * 2. it does NOT exist under the source root (`<from-root>/<prefix>/<rest>`).
 *
 * Half 1 alone would rewrite a mention of a file that never existed anywhere —
 * a placeholder in an example, or a typo — into a different wrong path. Half 2
 * alone would rewrite a mention of a file that moved AND was later re-created
 * in the source, which is a different file. Both were measured in the 70lx
 * sweep (bean `folio-assistant-beaf`, 2026-10-10): of 1,148 candidate mentions
 * in the harness, one named a placeholder and was correctly left alone.
 *
 * ## Records are never rewritten
 *
 * A record says what was true when it was written: a proposal, a todo, an
 * agent memory, a bean, a provenance record, an upstream pin, a test fixture,
 * a QA result. Rewriting one makes it say something that was never true.
 * {@link DEFAULT_RECORD_GLOBS} names the shapes the 70lx sweep left as
 * written; `--keep <glob>` adds more, and nothing here can remove one.
 *
 * ## Generated files are their generator's
 *
 * A generated page that names a moved path is rewritten by re-running its
 * generator after the sources are fixed, not by this tool: a hand-edited
 * generated file is the next `--check` failure. Pass the generated trees as
 * `--keep` (on cat-harness after 70lx, `docs/assets/**`, `docs/payload/**`,
 * `docs/reference/**`, `docs/uml/**`, `uml/**`, `docs/subgraph/**` and
 * `translations/**` held all 1,852 of the remaining mentions, and
 * `bun run cat regen` rewrote them).
 *
 * ## It reports by default
 *
 * Without `--write` it writes nothing and prints every rewrite it would make,
 * with file and line, so a person can read the list before anything moves.
 * `--check` exits 1 when any rewrite is still owed — the gate form, for a
 * sweep that should already be finished.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/rewrite-moved-paths.ts \
 *     --scan <dir> --from-name <name> --from-root <dir> --to-name <name> --to-root <dir> \
 *     --prefix <dir> [--prefix <dir> …] [--keep <glob> …] [--write | --check]
 *
 * `--scan` is the tree whose files are read (default `--from-root`). Only files
 * git tracks there are read, so build output and mounts are never touched.
