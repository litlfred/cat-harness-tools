Follow-up (a) of folio-assistant-core bean `folio-assistant-eief`, split out on the owner's ruling of 2026-10-10 (eief's option 1).

The extractors exist now, in folio-assistant-core: `scripts/tabular-csv.ts` and `scripts/tabular-xlsx.ts` (core PRs #33, #34, 31 tests). But:

- cat-harness `tools/index.ts` still declares `tabular-csv` and `tabular-xlsx` as **STUB** (`install: { none: true }`, `invoke: { manual: true }`). Replace them with real declarations invoking `bun run folio-assistant-core/scripts/tabular-{csv,xlsx}.ts`. They probably belong in folio-assistant-core's own `tools/index.ts` beside `dublin-core-render`, since the code is core's.
- `package.json` here names `check:tabular-stubs` → `cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-tabular-stubs.ts`, and `scripts/tests/tabular-csvw.test.ts` imports `../check-tabular-stubs.ts`. **That file exists in no repository** (checked 2026-10-10 in cat-harness-tools, cat-harness and folio-assistant-core). Its test asserts both tools are in the stubbed set, which must invert once they are built.
- `install: { none: true }` cannot mean "stub": `dublin-core-render` carries it as a working tool. Mark a stub explicitly, or drop the stub reading once no stub remains.

## Done when
- [ ] neither tool is declared STUB, and each invokes its core script
- [ ] the stub check exists where its package script says, or the script entry and test are removed
- [ ] `tabular-csvw.test.ts` asserts the built state, not the stubbed one


## Progress 2026-10-10 (lane B drain)

- **Correction to the bean:** `scripts/check-tabular-stubs.ts` **does exist** in cat-harness-tools (it came across in 70lx, commit d8d42ab), and `scripts/tests/tabular-csvw.test.ts` loads and passes on main (17/17 in the CI-shaped mount). The "exists in no repository" check above was mistaken.
- [x] **Done-when #3, partly; bullet 3 above:** `stubbedTools` read `install: { none: true }` as "stub", which would mislabel `dublin-core-render`. It now requires `install.none && invoke.manual`, with a test that an install-free runnable tool is not a stub (PR, lane B).
- [ ] **Done-when #1, outside this repository:** replace the two STUB declarations in cat-harness `tools/index.ts` (or move them to folio-assistant-core's `tools/index.ts` beside `dublin-core-render`) with real ones invoking `bun run folio-assistant-core/scripts/tabular-{csv,xlsx}.ts`. Once that lands, flip the assertion in `tabular-csvw.test.ts` ("the stubbed set is READ…") from `has(...) === true` to `false`. The ratchet then makes any leftover `fac:stub` an `expired` finding.
