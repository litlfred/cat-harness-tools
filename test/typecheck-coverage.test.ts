/**
 * Every TypeScript file here is either in the typecheck program or outside it
 * on purpose — never outside it because nothing named it.
 *
 * `tsc --noEmit` reports success, and its denominator is reported nowhere: a
 * pass over 1443 files and a pass over 1555 look identical, and moving a file
 * into a directory `include` does not name quietly drops it from the program
 * (bean `lvoa`, found when a whole instance's `scripts/` had fallen out). So
 * each file is put in one of three states:
 *
 *   - **covered** — named by an `include` glob and not by an `exclude`;
 *   - **exempt** — named by an `exclude`, which is a decision written down;
 *   - **unnamed** — neither, and the test fails naming it.
 *
 * Being named by a glob over-reports coverage slightly (a file can also be
 * pulled in transitively by an importer), which is the safe direction for a
 * gate that asks only that somebody SAID where each file stands.
 *
 * `**\/*.e2e.ts` is the one exclusion, and a recorded trade: Playwright
 * transpiles those files without checking them. Measured 2026-10-10 by adding
 * them to a scratch program: 9 type errors in 7 files, all in fixture literals
 * typed looser than the props they feed.
 *
 * The walk reads the filesystem, not `git ls-files`: CI mounts this checkout
 * with its `.git` removed.
 *
 * @module test/typecheck-coverage.test
