/**
 * `library-withheld` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/library-withheld.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`, owner
 * ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each reads a who-iris library
 * entry, which only the checkout holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none
 * of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
 * The rest of that file's tests stay there.
 *
 * ## The fixture, declared here rather than assumed of a folio
 *
 * Owner ruling 2026-10-09 (litlfred/folio-assistant#2521, ruling 2, option b):
 * withheld-viewer tests use a TEST-ONLY fixture. Until then this half read
 * `who-iris/library/withheld.json` and judged the COMMITTED viewer data
 * against it. The owner cleared every who-iris entry on 2026-10-08, so that
 * list is empty by design, its guard failed, and every per-entry assertion
 * below had nothing to run over.
 *
 * So the input is now a fixture — the approach cat-harness#45 took for
 * `library-withheld-viewer.e2e.ts`, with the same entry: a scratch checkout
 * holding ONE real who-iris entry (`who-pub-tps-931`, its blocks and its
 * cover) under a `withheld.json` that names it, in the shape
 * `gen-iris-pages.ts` writes (the 2026-10-07 gates and catalogue record). The
 * viewer data is then derived by the generator's OWN functions —
 * `readLibraryGraph`, `projection`, `entryBlocks`, `avatarCopies`, which
 * `library:viz` itself calls — never re-implemented here. Every assertion
 * below is the one this file made of the committed data.
 *
 * What the committed data still gets: `library:viz:check` regenerates it from
 * the real list and fails on any difference, so "the committed data is the
 * generator's output" and "the generator honours a list" are each proved, by
 * that gate and by this file.
