/**
 * No tracked shell reads `$?` where it no longer holds the command's status —
 * bean `0s6w`.
 *
 * Two shapes, both silent and both reporting SUCCESS:
 *
 * - `if ! cmd; then rc=$?` — inside that branch `$?` is the status of `! cmd`,
 *   which is 0. `publish-gh-pages.sh` refused to publish and then exited 0 on
 *   exactly this, a green step that published nothing.
 * - `echo "x $(other) rc=$?"` — the substitution runs a command first, so `$?`
 *   is ITS status. A merge steward read `rc=0` for a conflicted PR this way.
 *
 * The rule: capture `$?` on the line after the command, before anything else
 * runs — `cmd || rc=$?`, or `cmd; rc=$?` — then use the variable.
 *
 * @module test/shell-exit-status.test
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/shell-exit-status.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it asks git for every tracked shell
 * script and workflow in the checkout, `.github/` included, or pins the
 * detector that sweep runs, which only the whole checkout holds. Standing
 * alone, cat-harness has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone`
 * collects every test in that layer. Paths are composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the
 * directory it was written in, so nothing it reads changed.
