/**
 * A WITHHELD library entry says so in the rendered viewer — issue #1794.
 *
 * Measured before (PR #1799): both of who-iris's withheld entries rendered
 * every row as "(no content carried)", the sentence a page-scan with no text
 * gets. The viewer is client-rendered, so no grep of the committed HTML can
 * see what a reader sees; this opens the page.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE, declared here rather than assumed of a folio (owner ruling
 * 2026-10-09, litlfred/folio-assistant#2521, option b). Until then the
 * withheld entries were read from `who-iris/library/withheld.json`; the owner
 * cleared every who-iris entry on 2026-10-08, that list is empty by design,
 * and the banner went untested. The viewer's own index is now served with ONE
 * who-iris entry withheld — in exactly the shape `library-graph.ts` records
 * (the 2026-10-07 record of who-pub-tps-931, gates and catalogue record) —
 * and every other who-iris entry open, so the committed projection's state,
 * which `library:viz:check` deliberately does not gate, decides nothing here.
 * Real data is still judged where it lives: `iris:pages:check` holds
 * `withheld.json` to the catalogue's gates.
