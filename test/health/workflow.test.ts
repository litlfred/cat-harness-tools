/**
 * The tracking-issue path, exercised without opening one.
 *
 * Opening a real issue to test this code is forbidden here without the owner's
 * asking — so {@link render} is run over a fixture report and the resulting
 * issue body asserted, built through the same path the CLI uses.
 *
 * The workflow half — the daily trigger, and the clauses that decide which
 * step runs on which verdict, above all that **nothing may close the tracking
 * issue on `unknown`** — parses the index repository's own
 * `.github/workflows/health-check.yml`, so it lives in that repository's
 * `test/workflows/health-check-workflow.test.ts` (owner's ruling 2026-10-09,
 * litlfred/folio-assistant#2521, ruling 1(c)). What stays here is the issue
 * body, and the script name the workflow and a person run.
